To enable remote desktop access using XRDP with the GNOME GUI on Rocky Linux 9, follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable Required Repositories
Open a terminal and enable the CRB (CodeReady Builder) and EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repositories:

sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb sudo dnf install epel-release -y

Step 2: Install XRDP
Install the XRDP package:

sudo dnf install xrdp -y Enable and start the XRDP service: sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp

Step 3: Configure the Firewall
Open the RDP port (3389) in the firewall to allow incoming connections:

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Step 4: Set GNOME as the Default Session
Ensure GNOME is installed and set as the default session for XRDP: Edit the .xsession file in your home directory: echo "gnome-session" > ~/.xsession

Step 5: Test the Connection
Log out of your local session (RDP does not allow simultaneous local and remote logins for the same user).

Use an RDP client (e.g., Remote Desktop Connection on Windows or Remmina on Linux) to connect to your Rocky Linux machine by entering its IP address.

Tips and Best Practices

Ensure you have administrative privileges to execute these commands.

For better performance, use a stable network connection.

If issues arise, check XRDP logs located in /var/log/xrdp.log for troubleshooting.

This setup allows you to remotely access your Rocky Linux desktop with a smooth GNOME GUI experience.
